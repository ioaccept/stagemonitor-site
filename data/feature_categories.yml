  description: Stagemonitor widget is a little stagemonitor icon, which is automatically injected in the monitored
    webpage (if activated).
    It offers to view the call tree of the request and notifies based on configurable thresholds, if the request was
    too slow or too many SQL statements where executed. <br><br>
    The widget supports the developer through instant feedback about poorly performing parts of the application.

    - name: Metrics
      description: The Metrics tab displays metrics collected by stagemonitor in tables and graphs. It is a lightweight
        and easy to use alternative to the grafana dashboards as it does not require you to insall a database.

    - name: Call Tree View
      description: This tab displays the method call tree of the current request including SQL statements to identify
        the bottlenecks of a request. The method call tree is collected by stagemonitor's low overhead profiler.

    - name: Request Trace
      description: In this tab you can find detailed information about the request. This includes a breakdown of the
        page load time into network, server processing, DOM processing and page rendering time.<br><br>
        You can also see the execution time and count of database interactions.<br>
        Furthermore you can analyze the HTTP headers and find information about the device, browser and operating
        system the request was issued from.

    - name: Configuration Management done right
      description: The stagemonitor widget includes a configuration tab in which you can reload an dynamically update
        stagemonitor's configuration and view the available configuration sources.<br><br>
        For each configuration option, you can view documentation, find out about the configuration source of the current
        value, see validation errors and save a new value to a arbitrary configuration source.

- id: analyze-requests
  name: Analyze Requests
  description: Stagemonitor includes a <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/">Kibana</a>
    dashboard that can be used to get detailed information about incoming requests. You don't need to set up logstash or
    parse any logs for that.<br><br>
    You want to know what the most common source of errors is, what the series of requests that lead to an error
    looked like or why a request was slow? This dashboard will give you the answers.

  features:
    - name: Powerful querying and filtering capabilities
      description: Filter requests by queries or by selecting charts. You could use the query section to get details
        about requests that caused errors or where slow.

    - name: Detailed Request Traces
      description: In this section, you can find out about the root cause of slow or failed requests by analyzing
        stack traces of exceptions, request headers and parameters. The request details also include information about
        the user's login name, ip, browser and operating system. <br><br>
        You can even analyze the method call tree including sql statements and parameters to identify what
        caused a request to be slow. The method call tree is collected by stagemonitor's low overhead profiler.

- id: grafana-dashboards
  name: Grafana Dashboards
  description: The stagemonitor monitoring agent tightly integrates with the timeseries backend
    <a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview.html">Graphite</a> to store a
    long history of datapoints without overwhelming your disk and its dashboard extension
    <a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> to analyze graphed metrics.
    Stagemonitor includes preconfigured Grafana dashboards that can be customized. <br><br>
    To support clustered environments, you can select the application, instance and host in each dashboard.
    If you don't select a instance and a host, you get aggregated metrics.<br><br>
    Stagemonitor includes the awesome <a href="http://metrics.codahale.com/">Metrics</a> library. You can use it to
    track additional metrics - either programmatically or declaratively by adding annotations.

  features:
    - name: Request Dashboard
      description: The request dashboard gives you information about the statistical distribution of your page response
        times, the througput and error rate. You can also easily identify the requests with the highest response time,
        throughput and error rate.<br><br>
        Requests are grouped by use cases. Usecases are automatically detected if you use Spring MVC. For other
        technologies, you can group URLs by regular expressions.<br><br>
        Since version 0.8, stagemonitor features Real User Monitoring (RUM). That means, that you can select to either
        see the server time or total page load time in the request dashboard. Furthermore, you can find a breakdown of
        the page load time into network, server processing, DOM processing and page rendering time.

    - name: Server Metrics
      description: In this dashboard, you can get information about the Server Thread Pool usage, the number of
        concurrent sessions, the load of your hosts and the number of online servers. You can group these metrics by
        instance or host.

    - name: DB Query Dashboard
      description: The DB Query dashboard gives you information about the statistical distribution of your SQL statement
        execution times and the number of queries executed per second. It also lets you easily identify the slowest and
        most frequent SQL statements as well as the requests that issue the most SQL statements.
